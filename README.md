## Long-Context Narrative Consistency Checker (Track A)

This system determines whether a hypothetical backstory is logically
consistent with a long-form novel using evidence-based reasoning
over long contexts.

### How to run
1. Place novels in `data/novels/` and backstories in `data/test.csv`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python code/main.py`

Output is written to `results.csv`.
